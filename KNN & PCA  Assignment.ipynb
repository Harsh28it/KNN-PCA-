    "Question 1: What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and how does it work in both classification and regression problems?\n",
    "In KNN, “closeness” is defined via a distance metric (commonly Euclidean or Manhattan) computed between the new point and all training points. For classification, KNN takes the majority class among the k nearest neighbors (mode of labels). For regression, KNN predicts a continuous value as the average (or weighted average) of the target values of the k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: What is the Curse of Dimensionality and how does it affect KNN performance?\n",
    "The Curse of Dimensionality refers to various phenomena that appear when data lives in very high-dimensional spaces, such as most points becoming far apart and volume growing exponentially with dimension. For KNN, distances between points become less informative in high dimensions (nearest and farthest neighbors’ distances become similar), which breaks the assumption that “nearby points have similar labels,” leading to poorer accuracy and large data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)? How is it different from feature selection?\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that finds orthogonal directions (principal components) capturing maximum variance in the data and projects data onto these directions.PCA creates new features as linear combinations of original features (feature extraction), whereas feature selection keeps a subset of the original features without transforming them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors in PCA, and why are they important?\n",
    "In PCA, eigenvectors of the covariance matrix give the directions of principal components, and eigenvalues give the amount of variance captured along each component.Sorting eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues orders components by importance; components with larger eigenvalues explain more variance and are typically retained, while those with small eigenvalues can be discarded as relatively uninformative or noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5: How do KNN and PCA complement each other when applied in a single pipeline?\n",
    "PCA can be applied first to reduce dimensionality and noise, then KNN can be run on the transformed low-dimensional data, which often improves performance and computational efficiency, especially in high-dimensional problems. This pipeline helps mitigate the curse of dimensionality for KNN by concentrating most of the variance into a few components, making distance-based comparisons more meaningful.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification of cancer types using gene expression data is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research, with direct implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized therapy. However, gene expression datasets are characterized by an exceptionally high number of features (genes, often numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands) and a relatively small number of samples (patients), a scenario known as \"high-dimensional, low-sample-size\" (HDLSS) or \"large p, small n\". This imbalance poses significant challenges for traditional machine learning models, which tend to overfit, generalize poorly, and become computationally inefficient in such settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, dimensionality reduction techniques—most notably Principal Component Analysis (PCA)—are widely employed to extract the most informative patterns from the data while discarding noise and redundancy. When combined with interpretable classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), this approach offers a robust, transparent, and computationally tractable pipeline for cancer classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report provides a comprehensive, step-by-step explanation and justification of a PCA–KNN pipeline for cancer type classification from high-dimensional gene expression data. It covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Theoretical and practical aspects of PCA for dimensionality reduction in genomics.\n",
    "- Strategies for selecting the optimal number of principal components (PCs), including explained variance, scree plots, and permutation tests.\n",
    "- The integration of PCA with KNN for robust classification, including hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.\n",
    "- Best practices for data preprocessing, including normalization, log transformation, and handling missing values.\n",
    "- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation.\n",

    "## 1. Data Preprocessing for High-Dimensional Gene Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. The Nature of Gene Expression Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Gene expression datasets typically consist of measurements of mRNA abundance for thousands of genes across a limited number of patient samples. Each row represents a patient, and each column corresponds to a gene. The resulting data matrix is often sparse, noisy, and subject to various technical and biological sources of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1. Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is essential to correct for technical artifacts (e.g., differences in sample preparation, labeling, or hybridization efficiency) and to ensure that comparisons across samples are meaningful. Common normalization methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total intensity normalization**: Scaling each sample so that the total expression is constant across samples.\n",
    "- **Quantile normalization**: Making the distribution of expression values identical across samples.\n",
    "- **Median or mean centering**: Adjusting each sample so that its median or mean expression is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2. Log Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Gene expression values are often right-skewed and span several orders of magnitude. Logarithmic transformation (commonly log2(x + 1)) stabilizes variance and makes the data more normally distributed, which is beneficial for downstream linear methods like PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.3. Handling Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values are common in gene expression data due to low signal or technical failures. Imputation methods such as KNN imputation can be used to estimate missing values based on the similarity of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.4. Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization (z-score normalization) ensures that each gene has zero mean and unit variance. This step is critical before PCA and KNN, as both are sensitive to the scale of the features.\n",

    "\n",
    "The explained variance ratio for each PC quantifies the proportion of total variance captured by that component.

    "\n",
    "A scree plot displays the explained variance (or eigenvalues) of each PC in descending order. The \"elbow\" point—where the plot levels off—indicates diminishing returns for additional PCs. PCs beyond this point typically capture noise rather than meaningful structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3. Kaiser’s Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaiser’s rule suggests retaining PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1, under the rationale that each retained PC should explain at least as much variance as an original standardized variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Permutation-based methods (e.g., Horn’s parallel analysis) compare the observed eigenvalues to those obtained from randomly permuted data. PCs with eigenvalues exceeding those from the null distribution are considered significant.\n",

    "KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based supervised learning algorithm. For classification, it assigns a label to a new sample based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the feature space, using a chosen distance metric (commonly Euclidean).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Why Combine PCA and KNN?\n",

    "- **Noise reduction:** PCA removes noisy, low-variance components, improving KNN's generalization.\n",
    "- **Computational efficiency:** Fewer dimensions mean faster distance calculations and lower memory usage.\n",
    "- **Improved accuracy:** Empirical studies show that KNN after PCA often outperforms KNN on raw high-dimensional data.\n",
